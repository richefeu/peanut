# What is `PeanutVoxel`

`PeanutVoxel` is a software tool written in C++ that is designed to process 3D tomographic images. It is built on top of the CImg library, which provides a set of tools for handling and manipulating images in a variety of formats.

The primary function of PeanutVoxel is to identify particles and contacts within 3D tomographic images. This is accomplished through a combination of image processing techniques. Once particles and contacts have been identified, PeanutVoxel can extract quantitative information about them, such as their size, shape, and spatial distribution. This information can be used for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing the microstructure of materials, studying the behavior of granular media, or investigating the properties of porous media.

<!-- PeanutVoxel was initially developed for the PhD work of Kamilia, who used it to analyse the oedometric compression of soft spheres.
However, the software is meant to be extended with more features like 3D Digital Image Correlation and particle Image Tracking. -->
